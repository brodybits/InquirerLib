## Install

```{admonition} Requirements
python >= 3.7
```

```
pip3 install InquirerLib
```

## Basic Usage

`InquirerLib` provides two types of syntax that you can choose to use: [Classic syntax](#classic-syntax-pyinquirer) and [Alternate Syntax](#alternate-syntax).

```{Tip}
For any new users, [Alternate Syntax](#alternate-syntax) is recommended as its more flexible and extensible.
```

```{Note}
Checkout the sidebar on the left for detailed explanation and usage.
```

### Classic Syntax (PyInquirer)

```{Note}
Syntax ported from [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer) which allows easy transition between the two projects.
Checkout [migration guide](#migrating-from-pyinquirer).
```

```{eval-rst}
The :ref:`pages/prompt:prompt` function takes a list of questions and return the result.
Each question should be an instance of :class:`dict`. Different types of `prompt` could require different keys, please
refer to individual `prompt` documentation for detailed explanation.
```

As a rule of thumb, each question requires a `type` (type of prompt) and `message` (question to ask) key. For any `prompt`
involving lists, a `choices` (list of available choices) key is also required.

Optionally provide a `name` key, `prompt` will store the result under the provided name key in the final result. If
no `name` key is provided, the index of the question will be used.

```python
from InquirerLib import prompt

questions = [
    {"type": "input", "message": "What's your name:", "name": "name"},
    {
        "type": "list",
        "message": "What's your favourite programming language:",
        "choices": ["Go", "Python", "Rust", "JavaScript"],
    },
    {"type": "confirm", "message": "Confirm?"},
]
result = prompt(questions)
name = result["name"]
fav_lang = result[1]
confirm = result[2]
```

### Alternate Syntax

Alternate syntax directly interact with individual `prompt` classes. It's more flexible, easier to customise
and also provides IDE type hintings/completions.

```python
from InquirerLib.InquirerPy import inquirer

name = inquirer.text(message="What's your name:").execute()
fav_lang = inquirer.select(
    message="What's your favourite programming language:",
    choices=["Go", "Python", "Rust", "JavaScript"],
).execute()
confirm = inquirer.confirm(message="Confirm?").execute()
```
